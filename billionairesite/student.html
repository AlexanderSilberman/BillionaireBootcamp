    <tr>
    	<td class="terms"> ADR (American Depositary Receipt) </td>
        <td class="definition">  This is how foreign companies trade on the U.S. stock exchanges. An ADR is a 	negotiable certificate issued by a U.S. bank representing a specific number of shares of a foreign company.  </td>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
    	<td class="terms"> P/E (Price-to-Earnings Ratio)</td>
        <td class="definition"> This is the price of a stock divided by its earnings per 
share. It tells you how expensive the company’s stock is. A listing of “N/A” means that the 
company is losing money. It’s not uncommon for a new company or a company that is going 
through restructuring to lose money while it ramps up for new sales. General Motors lost money 
in 2006 and 2007—major restructuring—and so did Wisdom Tree, a new exchange-traded funds 
company with some of the top business leaders on Wall Street involved in the management and 
advisement of the company. 
 </td>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
    	<td class="terms"> Earnings per share </td>
        <td class="definition"> The earnings of the company are divided by the number of shares 
outstanding. For instance, a corporation with $100 million in earnings and 100 million shares 
outstanding would report earnings per share of $1. 
 </td>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
    	<td class="terms"> Sales and income </td>
        <td class="definition">  Be sure to check both of these statistics. A company could have a lot 
of sales, but still be losing money in income because the expenses are higher than the money the 
corporation is bringing in. Additionally, rising trends in sales and earnings are positive signs, 
whereas losing trends can be a sign of continued trouble ahead.</td>
    </tr>
    
    <tr> 
    	<td class="terms"> 52-week high and low </td>
        <td class="definition"> Check the annual low and high prices to get a perspective on 
whether or not you’re buying high on the year. Many sites also allow you to construct historical 
charts of the share price with one easy click. You can look at the history of the company’s share 
price for the past five to ten years and more very easily online. 
 </td>
    </tr>
    
    <tr> 
    	<td class="terms"> Market capitalization and number of shares outstanding </td>
        <td class="definition"> The market value of a company 
is the product of the share price and the total number of common shares. Multibillion dollar corporations provide stability for your portfolio and are less likely to have huge price 
fluctuations (either up or down). Companies with a smaller market capitalization, under one 
billion, perform better on average than the rest of the marketplace, but they also have a higher 
risk attached to that performance. 
 </td>
    </tr>
    
    <tr> 
    	<td class="terms"> D/E (Debt/Equity Ratio) </td>
        <td class="definition"> This is the total long-term debt compared to the market 
capitalization of the company. Extremely high D/Es could indicate that the industry, sector or 
company is not doing very well. If you see N/A in this column on the financial site’s stock page, 
go to the most recent earnings report on the SEC’s web site (SEC.gov) to find out the long-term 
debt, which is likely to be quite large. (Companies without any debt put 00.00 in the D/E 
column.) 
 </td>
    </tr>
    
   <tr>
   		<td class="terms"> Institutional Investors </td>
        <td class="definition"> Institutional investors move the markets. If you’ve found a 
company before the analysts discover it, you could benefit from increased institutional investors’ 
interest. 
 </td>
   </tr>
   
  <tr>
  	<td class="terms"> Operating Margins </td>
    <td class="definition"> This is the difference between the cost of goods (net income) and the 
price the company is able to charge for the product or service (net sales). </td>
