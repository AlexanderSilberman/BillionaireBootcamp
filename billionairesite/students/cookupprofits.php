<h4> Chapter 2 The Three-Ingredient Recipe for Cooking Up Profits </h4>
<br />
“If you like the store, chances are you’ll love the stock.”
—Peter Lynch
<br />
<br />
I got into this business because a large number of my friends came crying to me at
the end of 2001, saying that their husbands or their brokers had lost half or more of their
stock portfolio, and begging me to “teach them what I know.” They were quite a bit more
humble than they had been just a few years earlier. At the Christmas parties in 1999, I’d
told everyone within hearing range to sell their NASDAQ. I didn’t have extreme
confidence then, as I do now, that I was a great stock picker. I just knew that if you had
made 900 percent gains, the only way to ensure you kept them was to lock them in by
selling. I also knew that when companies lose money for five years, something wasn’t
adding up. Money doesn’t grow on trees after all. Sooner or later the people doling out
loans and investment capital were going to stop doing so, and when that happened, if the
company was still in the red, it would bleed out and go bankrupt. I also understood that it
was going to be impossible to have the world shopping online if everyone’s dial-up
connection was as crappy as mine was.

<br /> <br />
Most of my friends just avoided me and my wet blanket concerns, so they could
go on bragging about the 900 percent they’d made on AOL. Who wanted to talk to a
killjoy who was so stupid as to think they had to sell their stocks now and pay the taxes
on the capital gains? I was just a silly little single mom who lived in a condo. (Even
though I had become a vice president at a telecommunications company, most still
thought of me as a part-time schoolteacher who had no clue of the tax considerations of
rich people.) The few people who did stop to talk to me only did so to tell me how stupid
I was for not understanding the “New Economy.”

<br /><br />
While I would have rather taught my friends what I knew before they lost all of
their money, I was happy to enlighten them in 2001 so that they might prevent those
kinds of losses from ever happening again. Since these were upper-middle-class soccer
moms with to-do lists that were a mile long, I wanted to make investing as much fun as
shopping. (Incidentally, these women, who were much richer than I was, came to be my
friends from the nonprofit organizations that I donated my time to. More on that later.)
I wanted to give them a strategy that worked as reliably as a recipe. And I wanted
investing to be something they could do once or twice a month, if they loved trading, or
once or twice a year, if they wanted to take a long-term approach. I don’t obsessively
watch television or pray that the stock price will go up more than down every day, so I
wanted to assure them that these principles were sound and could hold up against another
recession.
<br /><br />
I believe (and so do Peter Lynch and Warren Buffett) that the average investor
can do great in the stock market simply by sticking with companies they know something
about. Buying stocks at random, without having a strong sense of or passion for a
product, means you could risk buying high or at the sunset of a product’s popularity (a
money-losing proposition). There are lots of gurus out there (with mixed credibility) who
offer all kinds of tips and expensive software to evaluate investments. I offer, instead, a
simple, easy-to-use, easy-to-understand recipe that allows you to size up the company
you know and love—by lining it up against the competition—and to evaluate the price so
that you never pay retail for the stock.
<br /><br />
Learning the formula takes as long as it takes to read this book. Applying the
formula takes less time than most people are already spending mainlining the daily,
largely superfluous and confusing “news” on every company traded on Wall Street.
Completing a Stock Report Card™ on the company you’re interested in and two
competitors should take about twenty minutes, less time if you employ power searches to
get the information. That’s the beauty of wisdom. Same amount of time and money =
better results.
<br /><br />
My Three-Ingredient Investment Recipe for cooking up profits is the foundation
of all successful investing, whether it is stocks, bonds, real estate, classic cars, postage
stamps or even Beanie Babies. When your evaluation strategy starts getting too
complicated, or the statistics make your head swim, make sure that your desired
investment passes the muster of this recipe. Keep it handy. Be religious about adhering to
it. It works—every time.
<br /><br />
<h4> Natalie’s Note </h4>
<br /><br />
There is one key consideration to the Three-Ingredient Investment Recipe for
successful investing in individual stocks and investments: You should not be trading your
nest egg or your house, condo or apartment to do it. That would be like juggling eggs, too
risky that you’ll break a few. When setting up and/or reviewing your retirement plan and
the home that you live in, be sure you:<br />
 <ul> <li> have your money properly allocated across assets
(bonds, money markets, stocks, et cetera). </li>
<li> have a long-term plan. </li>
<li> employ a rational roadmap to get there. </li>
<li> make sure that you will enjoy your investments (so you can
sleep at night). </li>
<li> keep enough cash on hand. </li>
 <li> protect a percentage equal to your age by investing that
portion in bonds, treasury bills, certificates of deposits or money markets. </li>
<li> employ an experienced, ethical, and talented Certified
Financial Planner. </li>
<li> maximize as many of the tax-free strategies as possible! </li> </ul>
<br />
We’ll discuss nest-egg strategies later on in the book. For now, we’re going to
focus on earning great gains in individual stocks (a smaller portion of your retirement
plan) by starting with your heart, seasoning with the wisdom you already have as
shoppers and adding a little brainpower to the mix.

<h3> Natalie’s Three-Ingredient Investment Recipe for Cooking Up
Profits </h3>

<br />1. Start with what you know and love.
<br />2. Pick the leader in the sector (in real estate, it’s location, location, location).
<br />3. Buy low; sell high (easy to say; hard to do).
<br />Any time a potential investment seems too complicated and twists your mind into
endless debates, go back to the simplicity of this formula. If it doesn’t pass this test, just
say, “Not now.” You still need more information before you can make a well-informed
decision.

<br /> <br />
Be disciplined about following the recipe. You need all of the ingredients, and if
you take the steps out of order, you could end up with a brick that sinks your profits,
rather than a cake that rises light and fluffy to Cloud 9. Since we all want to vacation on
Cloud 9 before we’re ninety, let’s sharpen your skills and start cooking.
