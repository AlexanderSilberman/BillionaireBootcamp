    <p>Natalie Pace created Billionaire Bootcamp in 2014 to educate teenagers on the basics of budgeting, money management and investing. The online games on this site give students the opportunity to learn in an entertaining and competitive environment, which not all teen financial literacy websites do. The content and games have easy integration into in-class curriculums <br /> offering teachers the ability to cover financial literacy in the classroom. Learning how to manage your money is invaluable, and our hope is this website will help make it something that is fun to learn! </p>
