#BillionaireBootcamp#
===================

The Billionaire Bootcamp group

This is the github page we will be using for the project for version control purposes.

I made the initial one so you guys have to clone it so we all have the same thing.

Before you can really do anything you need to send me your github name so I can set you up as a collaborator otherwise you have to do pull requests and stuff and blahhhhh.

Go into terminal or the command line (Mac and Windows respecitvely, get used to using them) and go to the location where you want to put all this stuff. 
Note: Cloning will make its own folder for you. So rather then making a billionairebootcam folder on the desktop and then cloning into that just go to your desktop since it will make a folder for you.

For Macs: Use ls to list all the folders and files that are where you are. cd followed by a folder name will send you to the folder. 

Example: 
ls  (ALL THE FOLDERS)
cd Desktop

For Windows I believe its dir instead of ls to list it out.

When inside do the command:  git clone https://github.com/AlexanderSilberman/BillionaireBootcamp.git

That will put the folder on your computer.

cd into that new folder.

Now you are connected to the repository.



##If you wish to add things.##

git status lists all the things that are new in your folder or have been updated. 

git add [file] preps a file to be added

git commit -m [some message in quotes] commits your files.

git push will push the files to the repository.
